          <h1>What is this project?</h1>
          <p> CAR PARKING WEBSITE is a website and my personal project to
            showcase some of the less skilled drivers I've seen, mostly in and
            around KlaipÄ—da. In 2018 my roomate and I made the observation
            that our parking lot's guidelines are appearently invisable to some
            drivers. After seeing that the poor parking jobs occoured really
            quite frequently we took note and pointed it out when exceptionally bad parking jobs
            were visable outside our doorm window. Months later I was assigned
            a personal website project in a web design class, and my freind made the suggestion I make a sight
            to host all of the laughably bad parking jobs we've seen. Hopefully you will share some
            bad parking jobs as well, there are plenty around that you will certianly find if you keep an eye open
            <br><br>
            If you have any inquires about the project or suggestions you would like to make
            please do not hesitate to ask
            <br>
